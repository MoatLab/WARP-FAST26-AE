## Phase 1: infrastructure setup

- Hardware and environment: x86_64 server with Linux 6.2.14 or 6.5.6
- DRAM requirement: 500 GB DRAM
- Disk space: (??)

- VM preparation: clone the WARP repo with <command> and pull the image with <command>. Then, move into <director> and run <./run_fdp_RU256.sh> to start the qemu VM
- Then connect to VM using this ssh <ssh -P 180880 warp@localhost>
- This process will consume about 1 hour and most of the time will be spent pulling the image 
 
## Phase 2: experiment run 

## Phase 3: Generate figures
